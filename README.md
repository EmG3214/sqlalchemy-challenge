Part 1 involves data analysis of the Climate Data
We first explore the precipitation data for the past 12 months of data
Then we analyze the stations 
Then we look at the temterature onservations

Finally, we create a Climate App with several analysis options
it pulls precipitation data, stations data, temperature observation data
There are even variable-based pulls dependent on the input from the requestor.
